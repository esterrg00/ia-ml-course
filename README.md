# Hello friend!

In october 2023 I completed the Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning 200 hours course in _Escuela de Organizacion Industrial (EOI)_ Spain platform. The contains were based in Python, separated in different units and mainly evaluated by three projects:

* **PROJECT 1** - Python Data Processing. This project was assessed your evolution skills with the programming language and the objective was get an update of data from a classification of a motorcycle grand prize.
* **PROJECT 2** - Hotel Chain Booking Cancelation Prediction. In this project the aim was work and know how to extract new information as of data set, in other words Exploration Data Analysis (EDA). Moreover, two differents machine learning models where used for study the best of them through GridSearchCV and the evaluation of best thershold where also studied by adjustment of ML metrics (f1-score, recall, accuracy, confusion matrix).
*  **PROJECT 3** - Classification of images of dogs and cats. For this project was used the _dogs_and_cats_filtered_ Kaggle dataset. There were created two deep learning models: the first one contained convolutional, pooling and neural layers. For the second model, there was realized a data augmentation for avoid overfitting effects, then a dropout layer and some changes in parameters were implemented for solution of this problem.

You can find all of these projects in this repository.
